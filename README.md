# Telecom-customer-Churn
Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecom industry, directly impacting revenue and customer lifetime value. This project uses powerBI to analyze telecom customer data and identify the key drivers of churn across customer tenure, service usage, contract type, and pricing behavior. 
This analysis reveals that churn is the highest among early tenure custmers, month-to-month contract holders, and users of high-value services such as fiber optic internet. Customerss without value added services like tech support and online security are significantly more likely to churn, while higher monthly charges further increase churn risk. In constrast, customers with simpler service needs demonstrate stronger retention.
By connecting customer behavior with service and billing patterns, this analysis highlights where targeted retention strategies can reduce churn, improve customer experience, and protect long-term revenue. The dashboard is designed to support executive decision-making and operational retention planning.
